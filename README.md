# unsupervised_classification
Trying to get a good unsupervised image classification method with clustering from different types of autoencoder outputs (Vision transformer or simple CNN autoencoders). I also tried using PCA projection to visualize the class clustering but it's not ideal.

First try of clustering on a simple autoencoder on CIFAR10 wasnt very efficient so i want to try with a masked autoencoder to see if it gets better at extracting class-relevant elements from images.
